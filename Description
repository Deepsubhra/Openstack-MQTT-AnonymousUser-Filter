Using this Winery Node type we can install MQTT broker with customized listening port and Anonymous user filteration using password authentication.

After deployment login to the instance and check the service is running or not using this command :         ps aux | grep mos

After that set your password as per your choice with this command : sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd deep             
Here deep is the user name for publishing a message.

Then restart the service with this command :   sudo systemctl restart mosquitto

Then check the anonymous user filtering with this command : mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test" -m "hello world"
